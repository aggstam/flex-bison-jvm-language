# flex-bison-jvm-language

Simple Flex and Bison programs producing the corresponding C code to validate
provided SimpleLanguage (.sl) file syntax, perform semantic analysis and compile to
JVM asembly(jasmin), which can then be executed.
<br>
SimpleLanguage syntax:
```
start {program name}
{command0}
    .
    .
    .
{commandN}
end
```

Two types of commands exist:
1. Assignment(affix format): ({var} (expression))
2. Print: (print {var or (expression)})

Assigment command example:
```
(x (3 4 +))
```

Print command examples:
```
(print (3 4 +))
(print x)
```

Notes:
- Each command is enclosed in parentheses
- Type casting and coersion are supported
- Variables are not declared(type is deducted by first assignment)

Compilation and tests execution is streamline via a Makefile.
<br>
Six valid and one invalid test SimpleLanguage files have been provided to play with.

## Usage
```
% make
```
Makefile can be configured to use a different test case set and/or files.

## Execution example
```
‚ùØ make test
flex -s -o lexer.c lexer.l
bison -v -o parser.c parser.y
gcc -Iexternal parser.c -o compiler -lfl
